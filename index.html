            <h2 style="text-align:center">Tesla’s mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.</h2>
            <p>Tesla was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers who wanted to prove that people didn’t need to compromise to drive electric – that electric vehicles can be better, quicker and more fun to drive than gasoline cars. Today, Tesla builds not
                only all-electric vehicles but also infinitely scalable clean energy generation and storage products. Tesla believes the faster the world stops relying on fossil fuels and moves towards a zero-emission future, the better.</p>
            <p>Launched in 2008, the Roadster unveiled Tesla’s cutting-edge battery technology and electric powertrain. From there, Tesla designed the world’s first ever premium all-electric sedan from the ground up – Model S – which has become the best
                car in its class in every category. Combining safety, performance, and efficiency, Model S has reset the world’s expectations for the car of the 21st century with the longest range of any electric vehicle, over-the-air software updates
                that make it better over time, and a record 0-60 mph acceleration time of 2.28 seconds as measured by Motor Trend. In 2015, Tesla expanded its product line with Model X, the safest, quickest and most capable sport utility vehicle in history
                that holds 5-star safety ratings across every category from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Completing CEO Elon Musk’s “Secret Master Plan,” in 2016, Tesla introduced Model 3, a low-priced, high-volume electric vehicle
                that began production in 2017. Soon after, Tesla unveiled the safest, most comfortable truck ever – Tesla Semi – which is designed to save owners at least $200,000 over a million miles based on fuel costs alone.</p>
            <p>Tesla’s vehicles are produced at its factory in Fremont, California, where the vast majority of the vehicle’s components are also made. As Tesla continues to expand its product line, Tesla’s production plan is also set to increase to a rate
                of 500,000 vehicles a year by 2018.</p>

            <h2>Tesla Model S</h2>
            <p>Boasting up to 337 miles of range, the Model S is the all-electric dream car envied by many. Icing on the cake is Ludicrous mode, which blasts the top P100D to 60 mph in a claimed 2.5 seconds. The lower-spec models offer reduced driving ranges
                and features. Luxury items such as an air filter that Tesla says can protect occupants from bioweapons and pollutants—plus available high-tech features such as Tesla’s Autopilot—seal the deal.</p>

            <h2>Tesla Model X</h2>
            <p>The Model X might be the greenest—and fastest—way to tote up to seven people over hill and dale. Models are designated by battery capacity and performance, ranging from 75D to P100D; EPA-rated range spans from 238 to 295 miles. A P90D we tested
                went from zero to 60 mph in 3.3 seconds, and Tesla claims a P100D can do it in 2.9. The X is actually practical, with all-wheel drive, a high-tech cabin, and striking but fussy Falcon Wing doors. Tesla’s Autopilot semi-autonomous driving
                is optional.</p>

            <h2>Tesla Model 3</h2>
            <p>Touted as the affordable electric sports sedan, the Model 3 is Tesla’s eco-friendly gift to the motoring masses. Rear-wheel-drive models should travel about 220 miles on a single charge according to the EPA; all-wheel drive may be offered
                eventually, and the optional long-range battery increases range to an estimated 310 miles. The Model 3 is appropriately quick, hitting 60 mph in 5.1 seconds in our testing. Options include a self-driving feature, which may someday be capable
                of full autonomy.</p>

            <h2>Tesla Roadster</h2>
            <p>The first Tesla Roadster was delivered in February 2008 to Tesla co-founder, chairman and product architect Elon Musk. The company produced 500 similar vehicles through June 2009. ... Simultaneously, Tesla began producing the Roadster Sport,
                the first derivative of Tesla's proprietary, patented powertrain.</p>
